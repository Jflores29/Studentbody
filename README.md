Simple code to pull data from a mysql database using PHP
This was done using a LAMPP stack (Linux,apache,MySQL,PHP,PERL)
After installing apache and MySQl on a Ubuntu Virtual Machine I did the following to run the php file 
1.Installed MySQL workbench
2.Run CREATEDB_and_Table.sql to create the database and table 
3.Next I created a USER for the PHP file to use for connection by running CREATEUSER.sql
4.Then I inserted values into the table created in Step 2
